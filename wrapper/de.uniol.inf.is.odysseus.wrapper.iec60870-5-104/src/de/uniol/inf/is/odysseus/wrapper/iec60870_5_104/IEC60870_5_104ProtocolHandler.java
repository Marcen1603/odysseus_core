/**
 * The IEC60870-5-104 protocol handler implements the IEC60870-5-104
 * communication standard. <br />
 * <br />
 * IEC 60870 part 5 is one of the IEC 60870 set of standards which define
 * systems used for telecontrol (supervisory control and data acquisition) in
 * electrical engineering and power system automation applications. Part 5
 * provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages
 * between two systems, which uses permanent directly connected data circuits
 * between the systems. The IEC Technical Committee 57 (Working Group 03) have
 * developed a protocol standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated
 * telecommunications for electric power systems. <br />
 * <br />
 * Amongst other documents and standards, the IEC Technical Committee 57 has
 * also generated the following companion standard: <br />
 * <br />
 * IEC 60870-5-104 Transmission Protocols - Network access for IEC 60870-5-101
 * using standard transport profiles <br />
 * <br />
 * The IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) protocol is an extension of IEC 101 protocol
 * with the changes in transport, network, link & physical layer services to
 * suit the complete network access. The standard uses an open TCP/IP interface
 * to network to have connectivity to the LAN (Local Area Network) and routers
 * with different facility (ISDN, X.25, Frame relay etc.) can be used to connect
 * to the WAN (Wide Area Network). Application layer of IEC 104 is preserved
 * same as that of IEC 101 with some of the data types and facilities not used.
 * There are two separate link layers defined in the standard, which is suitable
 * for data transfer over Ethernet & serial line (PPP - Point-to-Point
 * Protocol). The control field data of IEC104 contains various types of
 * mechanisms for effective handling of network data synchronization. <br />
 * <br />
 * The security of IEC 104, by design has been proven to be problematic,[2] as
 * many of the other SCADA protocols developed around the same time. Though the
 * IEC technical committee (TC) 57 have published a security standard IEC 62351,
 * which implements end-to-end encryption which would prevent such attacks as
 * replay, man-in-the-middle and packet injection. Unfortunately due to the
 * increase in complexity vendors are reluctant to roll this out on their
 * networks. <br />
 * <br />
 * IEC 60870-5-101 is a standard for power system monitoring, control &
 * associated communications for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated
 * telecommunications for electric power systems. This is completely compatible
 * with IEC 60870-5-1 to IEC 60870-5-5 standards and uses standard asynchronous
 * serial tele-control channel interface between DTE and DCE. The standard is
 * suitable for multiple configurations like point-to-point, star, mutidropped
 * etc. <br />
 * <br />
 * Features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Supports unbalanced (only master initiated message) & balanced (can be
 * master/slave initiated) modes of data transfer.</li>
 * <li>Link address and ASDU (Application Service Data Unit) addresses are
 * provided for classifying the end station and different segments under the
 * same.</li>
 * <li>Data is classified into different information objects and each information
 * object is provided with a specific address.</li>
 * <li>Facility to classify the data into high priority (class-1) and low priority
 * (class-2) and transfer the same using separate mechanisms.</li>
 * <li>Possibility of classifying the data into different groups (1-16) to get the
 * data according to the group by issuing specific group interrogation commands
 * from the master & obtaining data under all the groups by issuing a general
 * interrogation.</li>
 * <li>Cyclic & Spontaneous data updating schemes are provided.</li>
 * <li>Facility for time synchronization.</li>
 * <li>Schemes for transfer of files-Example:IED's will store disturbance recorder
 * file in the memory, When electrical disturbance is occurred in the field.
 * This file can be retrieved through IEC103 protocol for fault analysis.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Frame format: <br />
 * Character format of IEC 101 uses 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, 1 parity bit & 8
 * data bits. FT1.2 (defined in IEC 60870-5-1) is used for frame format of IEC
 * 101 which is suitable for asynchronous communication with hamming distance of
 * 4. This uses 3 types of frame formats - Frame with variable length ASDU,
 * Frame with fixed length & single character. Single character is used for
 * acknowledgments, fixed length frames are used for commands & variable lengths
 * are used for sending data. The details of variable length frame is given
 * below <br />
