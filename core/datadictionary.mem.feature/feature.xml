   <description>
      This feature provides the data dictionary for Odysseus. This version
of the datadictionary is not persisted (just in memory), so that e.g. all installed
sources and sinks are not restored and there is a fresh system after each restart. 

Note that there is also alternatively a filestore-based data dictionary that may not 
be installed simultaneously.
