     * approaches to meaning characterization and modeling.For example, in all
     * these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:- Beehive means
     * "a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box."
     * (Oxford dictionary)- 'Beehive' is a synonym in noun synset 09218159
     * "beehive|hive" (WordNet)- 'the term Beehive can be interpreted as the
     * fact
     * of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as
     * Bee,
     * Honey, Hosting, etc.'- 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation
     * expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer
     * away from inhabited areas'- 'the term Beehive expresses the concept
     * Beehive'- ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the same meaning
     * as for, say, fishermen'- 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to
     * fit
     * mine'- ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives'-
     * 'from the term 'Beehive', we can build a vector space of statistically
     * significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it'- the
     * lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame
     * 'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet)As the examples suggest, the 'meaning of
     * meaning' is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes.
     * One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of
     * meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and
     * difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give
     * up formalizing. However, the usefulness of having a 'semantic
     * abstraction'
     * in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web,
     * interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging
     * task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. We
     * provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using
     * the 'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.In
     * the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries,
     * glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or
     * 'gloss', or 'definition'). Another approach is provided by concept
     * schemes
     * like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a
     * 'concept', encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'.Still another
     * approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often
     * assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in
     * the mind or cognitive system of an agent. A radically different approach
     * is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that
     * meanings of an information object are spread across the communication
     * practices in which members of a community use that object.Another
     * approach
     * that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical
     * models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an
     * InformationObject
     * (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within
     * texts) in which that object is used similarly.The logical approach to
     * meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a
     * term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied
     * to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called
     * Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc.
     * Finally,
     * an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is
     * that
     * a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be
     * applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the
     * context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.These different approaches
     * are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different
     * aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled
     * within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from
     * exhaustive):(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense
     * semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and
     * reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference) -
     * Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled
     * as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and
     * different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases' -
     * Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is
     * modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject
     * and instances of Concept - Relational meaning (as for frame semantics).
     * Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of
     * InformationObject and instances of Description - Cognitive meaning (as
     * for
     * 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation
     * between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of
     * InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state
     * (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be
     * considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive
     * system, or neural system of an agent) - Cultural meaning (as for 'social
     * science' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation
     * between
     * instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject
     * (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.) -
     * Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is
     * modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of
     * InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that
     * isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector
     * space)(2)
     * Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is
     * assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between
     * 'expresses' and 'isAbout', which can be used interchangeably) -
     * Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic
     * semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an
     * instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that
     * isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the
     * ontology: http://www.loa-cnr.it/ontologies/IOLite.owl - Modal formal
     * meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the
     * expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an
     * instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some
     * different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorldThis
     * is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model
     * different aspects of meaning. A more developed ontology should approach
     * the problem of integrating the different uses of 'expresses', so that
     * different theories, resources, methods can interoperate.

    /**
     * Evento: Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.More
     * theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based
     * on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement,
     * etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical
     * participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).Here no
     * special
     * direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to
     * observable situations, and they can have different views at a same
     * time.If
     * a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based
     * classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many
     * modelling problems.(1) Alternative aspectual viewsConsider a same event
     * 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an
     * accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an
     * achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a
     * punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a
     * time point), or as a transition (something that has changed a state to a
     * different one). In the erosion case, we could therefore have good
     * motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b)
     * effectual focus, c) historical condensation d) transition (causality).The
     * different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to
     * live with this seeming paradox? A typical solution e.g. in linguistics
     * (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18
     * axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But
     * this solution would create different identities for a same event, where
     * the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.An alternative
     * solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable)
     * Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which
     * can
     * be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational
     * context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a
     * Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have
     * a
     * proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. For example,
     * ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as
     * a
     * process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles,
     * parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which
     * acts
     * as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a
     * Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a
     * state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a
     * different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state
     * transitions'.Consider that in no case the Event is changed or enriched in
     * parts by the aspectual view.(2) Alternative intentionality viewsSimilarly
     * to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a
     * same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been
     * caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an
     * intentional effort to activate those natural forces.Also in this case,
     * the
     * Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis
     * generates situations with different identities, according to what
     * Description is taken for interpreting the Event. On the other hand, if
     * the
     * possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are
     * taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because
     * we are adding a part to it. Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion
     * to
     * classify events or not depends on if an ontology designer wants to
     * consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.(3)
     * Alternative participant viewsA slightly different case is when we
     * consider
     * the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the
     * Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on
     * them. For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are
     * considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add
     * water, human agents, etc., makes the identity of an avalanche
     * change.Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the
     * designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense
     * classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb
     * synsets).Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will
     * keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way
     * we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea
     * that,
     * whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the
     * theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. Both positions are
     * in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues
     * that
     * are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which
     * only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to
     * conceptualize about a certain portion of reality according to their own
     * ideas. For this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are
     * allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling
     * needs independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer.

     * is an InformationObject from the viewpoint of ontology design, when e.g.

     * different notions of 'semantics': the first one is abstract and formal
     * ('formal semantics'), and formallyInterprets symbols that are about
     * entities whatsoever; for example, the term 'Quark' isAbout the Collection
     * of all quarks, and that Collection isFormalGroundingFor the abstract
     * class
     * 'Quark' (in the extensional sense). The second notion is social,
     * localized
     * in space-time ('social semantics'), and can be used to interpret entities
     * in the intensional sense. For example, the Collection of all quarks
     * isCoveredBy the Concept 'Quark', which is also expressed by the term
     * 'Quark'.
