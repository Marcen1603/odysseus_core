 * Database handle for the object.  It is of XML type “ID”, so is constrained to
 * be unique in the XML document within which it occurs.  An external identifier
 * for the object in the form of a URI may be constructed using standard XML and
 * XPointer methods.  This is done by concatenating the URI for the document, a
 * fragment separator “#”, and the value of the id attribute.
