   <description>
      This feature bundles all plug-ins that are needed for the use cases of the module named &quot;middle voltage data recorder (MVRec)&quot; of the research project NetzDatenStrom (NDS).
      (1) read IEC 60870-5-104 telegrams from a Pcap file, (2) change the timestamp of the first telegram,
      (3) change the timestamp of all other telegrams accordingly, and (4) send changed telegrams as IEC 60870-5-104, 
      using the timespam between timestamps of two subsequent telegrams as waiting time between sending the telegrams.
