Sprites
==============================================================================
Sprites are the representation of agents in the simulator. An example sprite
set is provided, buy you are free to create your own. Here's how:

1. Change the configuration file, so that the spritepath entry points to the
   base directory where you'll put in the sprites.

2. Create three directories, one per size, so that you have:
     ${spritepath}/16x9
     ${spritepath}/19x11
     ${spritepath}/38x22

3. In each of those directories, you need to put your sprite images, in png
   format, and named:
       NAME-OFFSETX.OFFSETY-DIRECTION.png
   where:
   	NAME is the name of the sprite, e.g. HumanBluue

   	OFFSETX and OFFSETY are the distances from the left side of the image,
   	and from the top side of the image respectively, which point to the pixel
   	in the sprite that should mark its position. In a person, this will usually
   	be centered at the bottom. For a car, it's a bit further up, and for a bird,
   	it would be way at the bottom of the image.

   	DIRECTION is the direction that this image is facing, where 0 is N, 1 is NE,
   	2 is E, etc.. until 7, which is NW.
   	
   This means that for each sprite, you will have a set of files of the type:
   		CarYellow-12.11-0.png
		CarYellow-12.11-1.png
		CarYellow-12.11-2.png
		CarYellow-12.11-3.png
		CarYellow-12.11-4.png
		CarYellow-12.11-5.png
		CarYellow-12.11-6.png
		CarYellow-12.11-7.png
   And this is per size!

Note also that the sprite name "invisible" is reserved. An invisible agent is simply
not drawn at all.
