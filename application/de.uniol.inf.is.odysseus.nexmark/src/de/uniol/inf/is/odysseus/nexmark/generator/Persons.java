 NEXMark Generator -- Niagara Extension to XMark Data Generator

 Acknowledgements:
 The NEXMark Generator was developed using the xmlgen generator 
 from the XMark Benchmark project as a basis. The NEXMark
 generator generates streams of auction elements (bids, items
 for auctions, persons) as opposed to the auction files
 generated by xmlgen.  xmlgen was developed by Florian Waas.
 See http://www.xml-benchmark.org for information.
